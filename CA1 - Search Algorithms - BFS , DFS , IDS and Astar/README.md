# Machine Learning Project

## Objective:
To get familiar with machine learning fundamental algorithms and their characteristics by SciKit-Learn library.

## Implementation:
In this project, we were supposed to predict the sales price for each house in the [House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/evaluation).

## Result:
In the image below, the log of one of the executions of the code is demonstrated. Accordingly, the correct combination has been found after 47 levels of genetic evolution in a relatively short time.
